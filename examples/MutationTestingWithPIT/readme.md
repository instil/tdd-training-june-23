# Mutation Testing with PIT
This is a simple Game of Life project with a handful of unit tests. There's a `pitest` gradle task that will run the PIT mutation test system against the code.


Run the pitest task, inspect the report (in build/reports/pitest) then write some new tests to kill the mutations.
